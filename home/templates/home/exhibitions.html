                <p>Beatriz Milhazes (Rio de Janeiro, 1960) loves nature yet this does
                 not imply that Milhazes creates true-to-life representations of such 
                 in her paintings. She originally found her way to floral motifs through decorative
                  art and through Pop Art.

                 The exhibition presents four monumental paintings that thematically explore the 
                 seasons. The height of the painting is identical for all four works; they only differ
                 in terms of width, which is proportionally aligned to the length of each respective 
                 season in Rio de Janeiro: Summer Love and Spring Love dominate, representing summer 
                 and spring respectively, while winter is the shorter season and then the smaller 
                 canvas.</p>

                <p>Apart from this series we exhibit also seven collages, a mobile, and a piece in
                 vinyl, Estadao was created especially for the Masters Entry of CAM and adds yet another facet 
                 to the exuberant and colourful vocabulary by Beatriz Milhazes.

                 In the words of the artist: “I recently found that ‘freedom’ is a word that describes my
                 work well. I think what characterizes my work is the freedom with which it combines
                 different concepts,images, colors, abstraction and figuration, all within a very rational and geometric painting. My 
                  way of working uses freedom with order.” This freedom runs through the multiple materials
                  and techniques in this exhibition.</p>

                        The beauty and elegance of Georgia O’Keeffe’s New Mexico paintings were prompted
                        by the intimacy of her experience with the Southwest’s natural forms, especially
                        in relationship to her paintings of the landscape surrounding her home at Ghost
                        Ranch. Further from home, she made repeated camping trips to draw and paint at
                        three extraordinary sites in the Southwest: Glen Canyon, Utah, and places in 
                        New Mexico that she referred to as “The White Place” and “The Black Place.” 
                        This exhibition presents a selection of fifty objects of camping gear belonging
                        to O’Keeffe—everything from her flashlight to her Stanley thermos.</p>

                    <p> The long drive from the artist’s home at Ghost Ranch made it an impossible day trip; 
                        painting and drawing the barren hills required camping. Between 1936 and 1949,
                        the artist returned to these sites many times to create more than a dozen
                        major works inspired by the astonishing landscape, isolated far off the road
                        and away from all civilization.  This exhibition complements Georgia O’Keeffe:
                        Living Modern, a new look at this iconic artist through her art, fashion, and
                        style. Which should be on view July 20 – October 20, 2021.</p>

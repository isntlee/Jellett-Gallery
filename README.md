# **Jellett Gallery**

There is no gallery in the country that exhibits female artists solely. Due to the disparities in public exposure for male and female artists, a female-focused space would seemingly be necessary. This gallery then is a space to promote young, upcoming female artists in Ireland. The site was built/designed with that goal in mind. This project uses as its guide, the concept of a collectively administered gallery; where access between the collective should be equal, this is reflected in several design choices.

# UX

## Project Goals

The aim of this project is to sell/promote the work of the gallery's artists. The project will showcase their work as well as offering them for open bidding/purchase.  Non-registered users can browse the collection, add items to a bid, make a bid and make payments. Registered users will have these completed bids displayed in their  "My Account" page. Registered users are not expected to pay an extra fee for postage, however unregistred users are. The project has also included scope for superuser access, or for committe member access. The gallery is operated as a collective with group responsibilty, a committee member has the ability to add/edit/delete individual pieces from the gallery collection. This is to allow the members to fully control their own collections.

#### Target Audience Goals

-  To learn about the nation's finest upcoming artists
-  Be able to browse their work, and make bids/purchases
-  An easy to use layout and design that works on any device
-  Registered users should be able to view their account and order history

#### Client/Site Owner Goals

-  Promote the work of the gallery and the artists/committee members
-  Generate funds for the gallery/committee members through the bidding/purchase system
-  Allow artists/committee members control over their collection in a user-friendly means

## Design

#### Framework

- [Bootstrap 4.5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - Bootstrap is a framework for building front-end projects, created and designed by Twitter.
- [jQuery 3.5.1](https://jquery.com/y/)
    - jQuery, the classic choice, I decided to make this a crucial part of my scripts framework.

#### Aesthetic

The central ambition of the gallery is to promote the art. The aesthetic was chosen to make sure the images take centre stage. This is achieved by bold uncluttered text, and a central monochrome contrast. In an effort to instill a professional impression, the decision was made to limit the palette to the gallery conventions. 

- (#FAFAFA)(**off-white** - *central colour*)
- (#020202)(**off-black** - *contrast colour*)
- (#555555)(**light-grey** - *link colour*)
- (#33ADFF)(**light-blue** - *hover effect*)

#### Icons

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)
    - This is the leading icon set and toolkit, it is completely fit for purpose. 

#### Alerts

 - [Sweet Alerts](https://sweetalert.js.org/docs/)
    - I decided to apply this visually improved option for critical decisions such as deleting an artwork within collections management. 

### Wireframes

- The wireframes for this site were made with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), and accessible in the folder [wireframes](https://github.com/isntlee/Jellett_Gallery/tree/master/static/wireframes)

# Features

## Current Features

### Artists

- The Artists link directs to the Artists page; here offering a list of the commitee/gallery members. The list is made of links that lead to the artist's collection.
    - There is a art display space on this page, which displays the artist's key piece when hovering over their name/link. 
    - The links open to the artist's personal page, containing biographical details and a list of pieces on sale/display at the gallery. 
    - These pieces can be bidded/purchased by first clicking on the title or image, that will lead the user to the artwork's detail page. Here the user is informed of the minimum offer/bid amount, and further details about the piece.
    - On the artwork detail page there is an "Add to Bid" button to allow purchase, this leads the piece being added to the cart/bag facility. Finally, committe members/superusers can edit or delete these piecesas there are buttons availiable on superuser status. 

### Accounts

**Register** 
- Found within the Accounts tab/icon:  Anyone can open/register a personal account. A username/password and email address is required. Email verification is in place and passwords are hashed to enhance security. 

**Login/Logout**
- Accounts tab/icon: For users with accounts, the sign-in procedure checks that the username/password matches the database record.  

**My Account** 
- Accounts tab/icon: This feature is open all registered users. It presents key user information, bidding/order history and an editable address form 

**Collections Management** 
- Accounts tab/icon: This feature is limited to commitee members/superusers. It allows these users to add pieces to the collection.  There are several required conditions to meet to add an entry such as name, description, offer/price, etc, etc.  

### Bag/Cart

- This icon leads to the bag/cart facility but referred to on the site as "Bid Details".
    - This is an opportunity to review the user's selection and remove any pieces from the bag/cart before bidding/purchase.
    - The icon displays on the navbar the number of items that are in the bag/cart.  
    - On selecting "Make Bid" the user is taken to the checkout facilty where purchase can be made. The page consists of a personal and billing details form, a summary of the bag/cart contents and payment form. Payment is currently made through the Stripe Online Payment Platform.
    - Unregisterd users are charged full delivery on their orders, while registered users are not charged at all. This feature is not mentioned on the site for several reasons; firstly, any attempt to offer "money off" might tarnish the gallery's reputation/brand and it was felt at commitee level that registering members/users should be encouraged but not blatantly.  
    - Successful payment leads to a confirmation page, that outlines the order's details in full and indicates that an email will be sent to the user's email address.

### Exhibitions/About Us Links

- These links lead to informative pages that are not interactive. They do have external informative links but that's the limit of their function. 

### Search

- Easily accessible search function, searches through the full collection based on title or description word-choice.
    - Sort-by function is present that organizes entries by set criteria whether the artist's name or the artwork's title.  

**Error Pages**
- There are two custom error pages for both 404 and 500 errors.



## Potential Improvements 

**Account Personalisation** 
- To build-in a series of additional options for the user after registering such as saving favourites, hiding personal entries that are still work-in-progress, undo entry deletes and an option to re-set passwords if lost. 

**Geo-location** 
- This would be a google map feature, that would indicate the location of important artistic centres in Ireland, especially Dublin. The user's personal location would update the map-centre as the page refreshed allowing real-time interaction. 

**Gallery app.**
- A gallery function within 'My Account' of the images of previous bid/orders.

**Rating system**
- With additional time, there would have been built a system to track whether a registered user had liked/voted for a piece or not, limiting that user to only ever adding one upvote or one downvote.

**Ranking system**
- This would exist on top of the Rating system allowing pieces to be displayed in artist's pags, and through search results, in terms of likes/votes.

# Testing 

### Validators

**HTML**
- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org) - The code is valid. 

**CSS**
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - The code is valid. However, errors fire due to the presence of Bootstrap framework in the base.html head. I have been told by tutor support to mention that "these are false positive results" and "this happens occasionally with third party libraries". The only warnings concern this same imported item: Bootstrap. 

**JavaScript**
- [JShint](https://jshint.com/)
    - The code is valid, all undefined/unused variables are concerned with jQuery, Stripe and SweetAlert
    - The three undefined variables:
        '$' , 'stripe', 'swal'    

**Python**
- [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/)
    - All python files are all right.

### Automated Testing

- Tests were developed with the Unit testing framework, these tests were applied to the application's routes/forms; see the separate app tests folders. Unit-tests are run from CLI with the command: "python3 manage.py test"
- There are two varieties of tests: route/form tests watching clear behaviour and tests verifying actions. 
    - Behavior: testing routes/forms, asserting that all cases behave correctly and returning a request succeed status 200. 
    - Verify actions: the tests created concern writing/deleting from the database. 

#### Travis

- [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) was used throughout the unit testing of this project to provide continuous integration with the deployed site. The [Travis Documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) provides all the info needed to set it up.
- I set the heroku deployment settings for this project to only allow deployment when the travis had passed the latest push to the master branch on GitHub.

### Compatibility

**Mobile**
- Chrome Developer Tools, Android(Samsung A5/Galaxy S8) and Apple(Iphone 8) mobile phones used to test appearance of site and its various features. There are very minor differences between android/ios but all are cosmetic e.g. fonts displaying slightly differently, pages scrolling more fluidly or details being more immediately responsive on ios. 

**Desktop**
- Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox all work and display correctly, testing done on a local system. Testing of Safari has only been conducted on [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), the site works correctly.
